The countdown started with a .js code with the purpose of 30 seconds.
Unsatisfied, I made changes until I got the result I wanted: minutes and seconds, in addition to this, at the end it is indicated that the time is up.

The request to enter the amount of minutes is made by a promp when the bubble next to the display is clicked.

As a last challenge, I wanted the display to show zero below 10 minutes or 10 seconds.
